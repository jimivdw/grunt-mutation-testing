# grunt-mutation-testing

> JavaScript Mutation Testing as grunt plugin. Tests your tests by mutating the code.

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jimivdw/grunt-mutation-testing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jimivdw/grunt-mutation-testing)

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-mutation-testing --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-mutation-testing');
```

## The "mutationTest" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `mutationTest` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  mutationTest: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

#### File options

##### options.code
**Required**
Type: `String` or `[String]`

List of source code files needed to successfully run your unit tests (including required libraries).

##### options.specs
**Required**
Type: `String` or `[String]`

List of unit test specifications that need to be run.

##### options.mutate
**Required**
Type: `String` or `[String]`

List of source code files that should be mutation tested.

##### options.basePath
_optional_
Type: `String`
Default: `"."`

Base path from which to look for the code, specs, and mutation files


#### Test framework options

##### options.testFramework
_optional_
Type: `String`
Default: `"karma"`

The test framework to use. Available values: `karma`, `mocha`.

##### options.karma
_optional_
Type: `Object`

Karma-specific options. See the [Karma documentation](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for available options.

In order for Karma to be able to run properly, it is necessary to at least provide the `frameworks` and `browsers` options. You should usually be able to reuse your existing Karma config file for this (by supplying it in the `configFile` option).

Note that some options (`basePath`, `files`, `background`, `singleRun`, `autoWatch`, and `port`) are overwritten automatically by the mutation testing framework.

##### options.mocha
_optional_
Type: `Object`

Mocha-specific options. See the [Mocha documentation](http://mochajs.org/) for available options.


#### Reporting options

##### options.reporters
_optional_
Type: `Object`
Default: `{ console: true }`

Configuration of reporters to use. Available options: `console`, `text`.

##### options.reporters.text.dir
_optional_
Type: `String`
Default: `"reports/grunt-mutation-testing"`

Directory to place the text report in.

##### options.reporters.text.file
_optional_
Type: `String`
Default: `grunt-mutation-testing.txt`

Filename of the text report.

##### options.maxReportedMutationLength
_optional_
Type: `Number`
Default: 80

The maximum reported length of the mutation that has been done. When set to `0`, the full mutation is logged regardless of its length.


#### Other options

##### options.ignore
_optional_
Type: `RegExp` or `[RegExp]`

Mutated code which matches this option is ignored.

##### options.excludeMutations
_optional_
Type: `Object`

A set indicating if a mutation should be excluded.

##### options.mutateProductionCode
Type: `Boolean`
Default value: false

When true, code is not copied to a temporary directory and mutated there, but instead the original production code is mutated, which can speed up your tests.

_Be careful when using this option_, as, in case the mutation process does not exit correctly, your code will be left mutated.

##### options.test
Type: `String` or `Function` 
Default value: No Default value

This test is executed for every Mutation. If it succeeds, this mutation is reported.


### options.mutationCoverageReporter.type
Type: `String`
Default value: undefined

Type of the mutation coverage (HTML) report that should be generated. Available values: `"html"`.

### options.mutationCoverageReporter.dir
Type: `String`
Default value: undefined

Directory to place the mutation coverage report in.


### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used to report every possible mutation.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    mutationTest: {
        options: {},
        target: {
            code: ['src/*.js', 'src/lib/myLib/*.js'],
            specs: 'test/**/*KarmaSpec.js',
            mutate: 'src/*.js'
        }
    }
});
```

#### Custom Options
In this example all mutations are reported, which cause no failure of the grunt script.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    mutationTest: {
        options: {
            test: 'grunt test'
        },
        target: {
            code: ['src/*.js', 'src/lib/myLib/*.js'],
            specs: 'test/**/*KarmaSpec.js',
            mutate: 'src/*.js'
        }
    }
});
```
Calling a test in this way is easy but **very slow**.
It's much faster to call tests directly by providing a test function.
This is demonstrated in this project's Gruntfile.js.

For your convenience you can easily configure fast mocha and karma tests:

##### Mocha

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    mutationTest: {
        options: {
            testFramework: 'mocha'
        },
        target: {
            code: ['src/*.js', 'src/lib/myLib/*.js'],
            specs: 'test/**/*MochaSpec.js',
            mutate: 'src/*.js'
        }
    }
});
```

##### Karma

```js
grunt.initConfig({
    mutationTest: {
        options: {
            karma: {
                waitForServerTime: 10 // optional, only used for illustration purposes here
            }
        },
        target: {
            code: ['src/*.js', 'src/lib/myLib/*.js'],
            specs: 'test/**/*KarmaSpec.js',
            mutate: 'src/*.js'
        }
    }
});
```

## Available mutations
Currently, the following mutations are available:

| Mutation code        | Description                                                   | Example                                                                       |

| `ARRAY`              | Remove elements from an array                                 | `[1,2,3]` to `[1,3]`                                                          |
| `BLOCK_STATEMENT`    | Remove statements from a block of statements                  | `function foo(x) { x = x * 2; return x; }` to `function foo(x) { return x; }` |
| `METHOD_CALL`        | Mutate parameters of a function call                          | `foo(x)` to `x`                                                               |
| `COMPARISON`         | Replace operators by their boundary and negation counterparts | `x < 10` to `x <= 10`                                                         |
| `LITERAL`            | Replace strings, increment numbers, and negate booleans       | `var x = 'Hello'` to `var x = '"MUTATION!"'`                                  |
| `LOGICAL_EXPRESSION` | Replace logical operators by their opposites                  | `x && y` to `x || y`                                                          |
| `OBJECT`             | Remove object properties                                      | `{a: 10, b: 'B'}` to `{b: 'B'}`                                               |
| `UNARY_EXPRESSION`   | Negate unary expressions                                      | `var x = -42` to `var x = 42`                                                 |
| `UPDATE_EXPRESSION`  | Negate update expressions                                     | `x++` to `x--`                                                                |

## Excluding mutations
Since not all mutations may be relevant for your project, it is possible to configure which mutations should be performed and which should not.

### Global exclusions
In order to completely disable a specific mutation, one can provide the excludeMutations configuration option. This takes an object where the keys represent the mutations and the values denote whether the mutation should in fact be excluded. For example:
```js
{
  mutationTest: {
    options: {
      excludeMutations: {
        'MATH': true,
        'LITERAL': false,
        'OBJECT': true
      }
    },
    // ...
  }
}
```
would disable the `MATH` and `OBJECT` mutations, while the `LITERAL` mutations are still active.

### Local exclusions
In some cases, more fine-tuning is needed for which mutations should be excluded where. It is possible to disable mutations _on block level_ by prepending the code with a comment containing the `@excludeMutations` keyword.

When only the `@excludeMutations` comment is provided, _all_ mutations will be excluded for the block above which that comment is placed. It is also possible to provide an array of specific mutations that should be excluded, e.g.:
```js
function foo() {
  // ...
}

/**
 * @excludeMutations ['MATH', 'OBJECT']
 */
function bar() {
  // ...
}
```
would disable the `MATH` and `OBJECT` mutations on the `bar` method and its contents, but not on `foo`.

All javascript comment types are supported, i.e. one can use both `// @excludeMutations` _and_ `/* @excludeMutations ["ARRAY"] */`. These comments can also be placed in the middle of a line of code, object, or function call, to allow for very specific configuration.

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
